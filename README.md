# The Monkees' Major Project

In this project I was assigned to make a website for the Pop-Band "The Monkees'". I chose to follow-up with the suggested band and not decide on a project myself as I wanted to experience a real-life work situation where clients would say what they wanted to be displayed on their webiste.

This website displays content through visual and audible stimuluses such as: picture and videos and also audio files aswell. You can find infomation about each band member, the band availability and also tour dates in the UK. Additionally, there is an "Archives" page where viewers can look at their Discography and also listen to selected songs.

 ## UX
 
 My method for the UX Design was to use the software Sketch (https://www.sketchapp.com/) to help me plan and design better.

## Features
### Existing Features

1. Landing Page - I used the concept of having a full-width image of the band with a button to enter the website stating "Come Backstage!" to add a more user-friendly experience.

2. Backstage - I thought it was a good idea to have a "Backstage" of the website as when bands go on stage there is a chance for some  fans to go backstage and meet the band. This has an exclusive feeling about it and creates a more real-life experience. It also shows a video of them performing a song and is the only piece of content as I wanted the backstage just to be a place where viewers can go where ever they want from there.

3. Meet The Band - This page is where fans or potential fans can know more about each band member. I used pictures of each band member and created a hover effect so when they hovered of the face it shows their name and when clicked it directs them to another page with more indepth infomation about them. This was to make it look more visually satisfying rather than having text about each one on the same page. On those pages will be general infomation about them (Birthday, Birth-place and insturments they play), Likes/Dislikes, History and also social media links.

4. Archives - A place where viewers can listen to the most popular songs, look at the whole Discography of the Monkee's and see when new songs are released.

5. Band Availability - This is where fans can see where and when The Monkees' will be performing with a button to be linked to a place where they can purchase tickets. Futhermore, It has a Band Availability where people can book out The Monkees' for weddings etc.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

-----

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
